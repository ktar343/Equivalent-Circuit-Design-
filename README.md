# Equivalent-Circuit-Design-
2-RC Equivalent Circuit Design using MATLAB and Simulink


Welcome, my Repository related to LIBs

At here, you can show the MATLAB code which used to calculated Resistance and Capacitance from OCV data, and the Simulink block configuration.

The below image is overall Equivalent circuit with 2-RC, SoH block and Cycler etc.

The 2-RC Equivalent circuit represents the NCM cathode properties of cylindrical cell including resistance(ohmic, SEI, charge transfer) and capacitance(C1, C2)

The SoH block consists of SoC, Temperature, R0 accroding to cycle.

The Cycler consists of Discharger and Charger
