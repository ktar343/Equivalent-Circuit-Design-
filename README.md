# Equivalent-Circuit-Design-
2-RC Equivalent Circuit Design using MATLAB and Simulink


Welcome, my Repository related to LIBs

At here, you can see the MATLAB code which used to calculated Resistance and Capacitance from OCV data, and the Simulink block configuration.

The below image is overall Equivalent circuit with 2-RC, SoH block and Cycler etc.

The 2-RC Equivalent circuit represents the NCM cathode properties of cylindrical cell including resistance(ohmic, SEI, charge transfer) and capacitance(C1, C2)

The SoH block consists of SoC, Temperature, R0 accroding to cycle.

The Cycler consists of Discharger and Charger using Realy block

### [result of SoH according to degardation]
In past, I solved this problem using 3-RC circuit, But I doesn't have this file.... It's my fault...
Instead, I upload former file while consists of 2-RC circuit.
